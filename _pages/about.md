I am a senior undergraduate student in biomedical engineering at [Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/BME){:target="\_blank"}. My main interest of `computational psychiatry` lies at the junction of psychology, neuroscience and computer science. This field attempts to apply the developed mathematical models to specific clinical application. With that, the topics I am interested include (but not limited to)

* Bayesian brain theory: perception and reality
* Belief update and predictive coding
* Precision medicine for psychiatric disorders
* Neuroengineering 
<!---* Reward processing and goal-directed exploration-->

The motivation of participating in the field came from the class called `Translational Neuromodeling` taught by [Klaas Enno Stephan](https://www.tnu.ethz.ch/en/team/faculty-and-scientific-staff/stephan#c333) of [translational neuromodeling unit](https://www.tnu.ethz.ch/en/teaching/translational-neuromodeling){:target="\_blank"} at ETH Z&uuml;rich, which I went studying abroad for a semester. The class gave me an initial idea on the fact that heterogeneous nature of psychiatric disorders were not captured by current diagnostic tool, [DSM-5](https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm){:target="\_blank"}, and using mathematical modeling, a more meaningful and unique causal relationship between the disorder and their causes could be established.

Currently, I am working with [Maria Dadarlat](https://engineering.purdue.edu/BME/People/ptProfile?resource_id=224725){:target="\_blank"} on a project about decoding mouse movements from neural data using recurrent neural network (RNN), giving me a firm ground on neural data processing. Please feel free to contact me via email for a discussion.
